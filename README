 About:       VarTypes is a feature-rich, object-oriented framework
              for managing variables in C++ / QT4.

 Features:    VarTypes allows hierarchical organization, thread-safety,
              load/store to/from xml, QT4-based signals, QT4-based model/view
              visualization.

              VarTypes aims to make it easy for application developers to
              integrate automatic settings loading/storage, even for complex
              trees of settings. At the same time it allows a user to comfortably
              edit such settings in real-time without any risks of concurrency
              problems.

              Among supported base types are int, bool, double, string,
              string enumerations, lists, binary data, and triggers.
              More complex types can be added easily by inheriting the
              VarData base-class.

 Usage:       An example including the QT4 GUI is located in the example/
              directory. To build, make sure you have QT >= 4.3 installed
              then cd into "example/" and run "qmake example.pro"
              (note that on some distributions it's "qmake-qt4" instead
              of just qmake. In fact qmake might link to qmake3 which
              will fail miserably on the QT4-style .pro file).
              Qmake will generate a standard makefile.
              Then run "make" and it should build the program.
              You can then run the program "./example"

              All the interesting code on how to construct a vartree and
              GUI is located in example/mainwindow.cpp


 Files:       vartypes/primitives/
                  includes all basic vartype-datastructures

              vartypes/VarTypes.h
                  is the main header to include to make use of the system

              vartypes/primitives/VarData.h
                  is the base-class of all vartypes

              vartypes/gui/
                  includes all GUI related QT widgets. Note that some of
                  them are in development and/or deprecated.
                  You will only need to compile the ones as shown in
                  the example code (see example/example.pro).

             vartypes/enhanced/ and vartypes/experimental/
                  are some currently experimental time-based types. It is
                  recommended you don't use or compile these yet.

             vartypes/xml/
                  includes the XML file parser/writer which was written by
                  and is copyrighted by Frank Vanden Berghen.
